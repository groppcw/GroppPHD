This file is for scribbling down any ideas we have, to be refined or used as inspiration later.

# Letter transposition experiment
* Explore sentiment analysis for classifier?
* Search for flame wars on Reddit to use as input data
* Examine science of typos so as to avoid existing typos when creating attacks; perhaps look for something like a blossom matrix?

# General adversarial ideas
* Look at meta behavior of hybrid models, look for things that are usually correlated and flag examples that aren't as possible attacks
* A lot of these attack patterns are incredibly obvious to humans; can we train something to recognize it's under attack?
