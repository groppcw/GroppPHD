# Literature Survey

This file will include summaries of papers read or identified as worth reading. It will be a companion to an overleaf document of similar purpose.

If there is no comment beneath a paper, assume it hasn't been read yet.

## Motivating Problems

* Motivation for and Evaluation of the First Tensor Processing Unit (TPU).
    * Paper by Google about their TPU. Hardware description is unlikely to be relevant to our work, but the paper discusses the workload properties of DNN workflows and their importance.
