# Literature Survey

This file will include summaries of papers read or identified as worth reading. It will be a companion to an overleaf document of similar purpose.

If there is no comment beneath a paper, assume it hasn't been read yet.

## Motivating Problems

* Motivation for and Evaluation of the First Tensor Processing Unit (TPU).
    * Paper by Google about their TPU. Hardware description is unlikely to be relevant to our work, but the paper discusses the workload properties of DNN workflows and their importance.

### Letter Transposition Problem

* Andrews, S (1996) Lexical retrieval and selection processes: Effects of transposed-letter confusability. Journal of Memory and Language, 35(6), 775-800.
    * Substantial discussion about different models of how people identify words, and their various failings.
    * Experiments look at the effect of letter transposition on word identification; it appears that people are pretty good at recognizing actual words regardless of being close to other higher frequency words, but that it takes people longer to catch on that a nonword formed by switching two letters in a real, frequent word is wrong.
